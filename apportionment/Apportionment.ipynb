    "**Background** \n",
    "Every ten years, the U.S. House of Representatives is reapportioned according to the census for that decade. The Constitution specifies that \"Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers\" but prescribes no method to accomplish this. It is not a simple matter of multiplying the total number of seats in the House by each state's fraction of the population, since the resulting numbers of seats will generally not be integers. Many apportionment methods that assign each state an integer number of seats have been proposed, including methods proposed by Thomas Jefferson, John Quincy Adams, Alexander Hamilton, and Daniel Webster. Due to the political implications of the gain or loss of even one seat, disputes over apportionment methods have occurred many times, on the grounds that a proposed method is biased against states with small or large populations. The first such dispute resulted in George Washington's first veto. The last such dispute, over the apportionment for the 1990 census, went to the Supreme Court."

How to round so that the total remains fixed and to do so in a way that is fair to each state is the apportionment problem. Alexander Hamilton proposed adjusting the rounding either above or below 0.5 until the desired number of total seats is achieved. Hamilton's method is coded below in three cells. The first cell adjusts the rounding. The second cell applies the rounding and the third applies the method to the census data."

Furthermore, we want the number of apportioned seats for the family to be as close as possible to $Q$ according to a measure of closeness such as Webster rounding which minimizes $|S-Q|$ or Huntington-Hill rounding which minimizes $|\\log S - \\log Q |$. We call an apportionment method that satisfied these properties, such as Webster's method applied to families and the Huntington-Hill method applied to families, an impartial method.
